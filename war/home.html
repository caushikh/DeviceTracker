			home after being out. During this time you are full of doubts and fears for 
			their safety. You do not know where they are and if they are driving home

			home safely.</p>

			your loved ones' positions on a map while they are making their way home. GPS
			technology figures out where they are and puts it on a map to allow you to 
			clearly see where they are. It updates their position quickly so you have a 
			more or less instant feedback as to where they are. So give up all the worrying
			and start using Cartracker today!</p>

			Then you will be able to register your devices, start tracking and monitor 
			the routes taken by your loved ones. Plus, you will even be able to save routes
			and view them later if need be.</p>
